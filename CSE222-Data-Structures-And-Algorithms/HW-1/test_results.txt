HOUSE INFO: 
Position: 1
Length: 5
Height: 5
Street Side: Left
Number of Rooms: 3
Color: Yellow

Lets create 2 house objects and print their hashCodes
Hashcode of the first house: -1790729440
Hashcode of the second house: 544203796

4.4: TESTING .clone() METHOD

Lets test clone method with house object
